        <h2>Basic Anatomy Of A Website</h2>
        <p>Let’s start by defining the various parts of a website:</p>

        <article>
            <h3>Header</h3>
            <p>The header is the top section of a website, where you’ll usually find the logo and the site’s navigation menu. It’s that steady, reliable part of the page that stays visible no matter where visitors click on your site.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Pre-header</h3>
            <p>The pre-header is the thin strip that sits above the main header. It’s often used to display helpful information like your contact details, business hours, special offers, or even secondary navigation links. Think of it as a small but mighty space for quick-access details that your visitors might appreciate seeing right away.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Favicon</h3>
            <p>A favicon is the small icon that appears in a browser tab next to your website title. It’s usually a simplified version of your logo or brand mark. Favicons help visitors quickly identify your website when they have multiple tabs open, and they add a polished, professional look to your site.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h3>Navigation (aka Navigation Bar or Main Menu)</h3>
            <p>The navigation is the set of links at the top of a website that helps visitors find what they’re looking for. These links are usually part of the header or located just below it.</p>
        </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Breadcrumbs</h3>
            <p>Breadcrumbs are a type of navigation that shows visitors their location within a website’s hierarchy. They usually appear near the top of the page and look something like this:</p>
            <p>Home > Blog > Latest Posts > Post Title</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Website Content</h3>
            <p>When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or body copy, but website content goes beyond just words.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Homepage (or home page)</h3>
            <p>The homepage — also called the front page or main page — is the starting point of most websites. It’s often the first page visitors see and serves as a central hub to guide them through your site.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Homepage Hero Area (aka Feature Area aka Headline Area)</h3>
            <p>The Homepage Hero Area is the top section of a homepage that grabs your attention and introduces the site’s primary message. It often spans the full width of the page and typically includes key elements like:</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Slider</h3>
            <p>A slider is a feature on a  that displays a rotating series of images, like a slideshow. The images usually slide horizontally from one to the next, though some sliders use fade effects instead.</p>
         </article>
         
         <article>
            <h3>Alt Text</h3>
            <p>Alt text (short for “alternative text”) is a brief description added to images on a website. It serves two main purposes:</p>
            <p>1. It makes websites more accessible by describing images to visually impaired users who rely on screen readers.</p>
            <p>2. It helps search engines understand what an image is about, which can improve your website’s SEO.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Sidebar</h3>
            <p>A sidebar is the narrow vertical column that appears alongside your main website content. It’s often used to display things like advertisements, links to other content, calls to action, or a search box. Think of it as a supporting area for secondary information that complements the primary content.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Sub-Footer</h3>
            <p>The sub-footer is the section that appears at the bottom of a webpage—just above the main footer—and is consistent across your site. Think of it as a secondary navigation bar that provides additional points of access or contact details once visitors have scrolled through the primary content. While its content varies by site, a sub-footer typically includes elements such as:</p>
            <p><h4>Quick Contact Information:</h4>Displaying addresses or phone numbers for immediate reference.</p>
            <p><h4>Supplementary Navigation Links:</h4>Offering shortcuts to key pages like “About Us,” “Services,” or even “Our Locations.”</p>
            <p><h4>Social Media Icons:</h4>Allowing visitors easy access to your social profiles. Allowing visitors easy access to your social profiles.</p>
            <p><h4>Additional Resources:</h4>This might include links to site maps or ancillary informational pages.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Footer (The "True" Footer)</h3>
            <p>The footer is the final, definitive section at the very bottom of a webpage. It typically contains essential legal, informational, and administrative details that are less frequently updated but are critical for compliance and user trust. Common footer contents include:</p>
            <p><h4>Copyright and Legal Disclaimers:</h4>Noting trademark rights and the copyright year.</p>
            <p><h4>Policy Links:</h4>Links to the privacy policy, terms of use, and any other legal information.</p>
            <p><h4>Site Map:</h4>A detailed breakdown of the website’s structure for improved navigation and SEO.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Landing Page</h3>
            <p>A landing page is a specific page on your website where visitors “land” after clicking on an ad—whether it’s from Google, Facebook, or anywhere else.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Call To Action (aka CTA)</h3>
            <p>A call to action (or CTA) is a specific and direct request asking visitors to take a desired action. CTAs can take many forms: buttons, popups, ribbons, slide-ins, email opt-in boxes, or even a simple text link.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Above the Fold</h3>
            <p>“Above the fold” refers to the part of a webpage you immediately see before you start scrolling. Placing your call-to-action (CTA) above the fold ensures visitors see it right away, increasing the likelihood they’ll take action—like clicking a button or filling out a form.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Blog</h3>
            <p>A blog is a type of website—or a section of a larger website—that features content published as individual posts in chronological order, like journal entries in a diary.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Card Design (aka Tile Design or Grid-Based Design)</h3>
            <p>Card design organizes content into visually distinct “cards” or tiles, often arranged in a grid layout. Popularized by sites like Pinterest, this design style is clean, easy to scan, and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
            <h4>Image galleries</h4>
            <p><h4>Blog pages</h4>to showcase multiple posts</p>
            <p><h4>Sales pages</h4>to highlight features, benefits, or services</p>
         </article>

            <h2>Additional Terminology Of Modern Websites</h2>
            <h3>WordPress</h3>
            <p>WordPress powers <a href="">millions of websites</a> worldwide and is one of the most popular tools for building and managing websites.</p>
            <p><h4>Themes:</h4>A WordPress theme controls how your site looks. It’s what transforms WordPress into a functional website. There are thousands of themes—some free, some paid—and most can be customized to match your company’s brand. Using a theme is far faster (and cheaper) than building a website entirely from scratch, like we had to do back in the early 2000s.</p>
            <p><h4>Plugins:</h4>Plugins add functionality to your site, much like apps on your phone. With tens of thousands of WordPress plugins available, you can add features like contact forms, image galleries, site security, shopping carts—pretty much anything you can imagine.</p>

            <h3>WordPress Page vs. WordPress Post</h3>
            <p>This takes a bit of explaining, so I wrote a whole piece on the similarities and differences between WordPress pages and posts, which you can find <a href="">here</a></p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Hosting</h3>
            <p>To have a website on the internet, it needs to be hosted on a web server. Think of hosting as the piece of land where your website “lives.” Just like you need land to build a house, you need a server to store your website’s files and make them available to people on the internet.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Caching</h3>
            <p>Caching is the process of storing a temporary version of a website or webpage to help it load faster. When someone visits your website, a cached version can be delivered quickly instead of forcing the browser to fetch everything from scratch.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Domain Name (aka URL)</h3>
            <p>A domain name is the address people type into their browser to visit a website—like Amazon.com, CNN.com, or markbrinker.com.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Domain Registrar</h3>
            <p>A domain registrar is where you purchase and register your domain name—kind of like getting a license plate for your car from the DMV.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>301 Redirect</h3>
            <p>A 301 redirect is a way to permanently send visitors (and search engines) from one URL to another. It’s often used when you update your website’s structure, change a page’s URL, or move your site to a new domain.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>404 Error Page</h3>
            <p>A 404 error page appears when someone tries to visit a page on your website that doesn’t exist — either because the page was deleted, the URL was mistyped, or the link is broken.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>DNS</h3>
            <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. Think of it as the phone book of the internet.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it’s the standard language used to create websites and web pages. Invented in 1991 by <a href="">Tim Berners-Lee</a> (the creator of the World Wide Web), HTML allows developers to structure content on a webpage using tags for elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage, CSS is what makes it look good. It controls the design—things like fonts, colors, spacing, and layout.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Website Builder</h3>
            <p>A website builder is an all-in-one tool that allows you to design and build a website without needing to write code. Website builders typically feature drag-and-drop editors, making them easy to use, even for those with minimal technical experience.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Mobile Responsive</h3>
            <p>A mobile responsive website automatically morphs to fit the shape and size of the screen it’s being viewed on—whether that’s a phone, tablet, or desktop. It uses CSS to adjust the layout, navigation, and font sizes seamlessly, so the site is easy to use and read on any device.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>SSL</h3>
            <p>SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. An SSL certificate encrypts the data sent between a website’s server and your browser, ensuring that hackers can’t intercept or read it.</p>
         </article>   

         <article>
            <h3>SEO</h3>
            <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It’s the process of configuring your website to get free traffic from search engine results pages (often referred to as SERPs).</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
            <p><a href="">Google Analytics</a> is a free service from Google that provides statistics about your website—like how many visitors you’re getting, which pages they’re viewing, and how long they’re spending on each page.</p>
         </article>

         <article>
            <h3>Email Service Provider (ESP)</h3>
            <p>An email service provider (sometimes called an email management service or EMS) helps you build, manage, and communicate with your list of email subscribers.</p>
            <p><h4>Automation:</h4>Users can add or remove themselves from your list automatically. You can also set up emails to send based on specific user actions (e.g., signing up for your list).</p>
            <p><h4>Scalability:</h4>Send a single broadcast email to hundreds or thousands of subscribers with just a click—something that’s nearly impossible to do manually.</p>
            <p><h4>Deliverability:</h4>Email service providers are “whitelisted,” so your messages are less likely to be flagged as spam. If you try sending too many emails in quick succession with tools like Outlook or Gmail, your ISP might block them.</p>
            <p><h4>Compliance:</h4>Helps you stay compliant with email regulations like the CAN-SPAM Act to avoid penalties.</p>
            <p><h4>Reporting & Tracking:</h4> See valuable stats like email open rates, link clicks, and which subject lines perform best.</p>
