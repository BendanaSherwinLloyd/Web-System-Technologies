                <p>Web design and page structure play a big role in encouraging users to click and scroll.</p>
                <h2>Why do you need to think about page structure</h2>
                <p>Let’s start by defining what a webpage is, as it is not the same as a website.</p>
                <p>The organized webpage is the foundation of your online presence.</p>

                <div><p>A well-structured page leads users smoothly from beginning to end.</p></div>

                <h2>19 crucial elements of a web page</h2>
                <p>When it comes to designing a webpage, it’s all about picking the right elements.</p>
                <h2>1. Header</h2>
                <p>First up is the header or a site menu.</p>

                <div><p>The header is your first chance to make an impression, so you’ve got to make it count.</p></div>

                <p>Your header is a site guide that ensures visitors know exactly where they are and how to find what they’re looking for.</p>
                <img src="" alt="header image">
                <p>A visible and informative header presents a site’s content</p>

                <div><a href=""><img src="" alt=""> Uncover the secrets of impactful header design through our best practices guide in the Website Header Inspiration article.</a></div>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>2. CTA button</h2>
                <p>Next on the list is the Call to Action (CTA) buttons that guide your visitors on what to do next, whether it’s “Buy Now,” “Learn More,” or “Sign Up.”</p>
                <p>However, it’s not just about slapping a button anywhere.</p>
                <p>Remember, the CTA button is your chance to convert a casual visitor into a customer or subscriber.</p>
                <img src="" alt="CTA button image">
                <p>A clear CTA button leads users to the next step</p>

            <article>
                <h2>3. Hero section</h2>
                <p>Moving on, let’s talk about the hero section. </p>

                <div><p>Whether you’re showcasing a product, highlighting a service, or setting the mood, your hero section should be visually striking and emotionally resonant.</p></div>

                <p>This component needs to connect with your visitors immediately, telling them what your site is about and what they can expect from it.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Hero section image">
                <p>A hero section captivates at first glance</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>4. Footer</h2>
                <p>Scrolling down to the bottom of the page, you’ll find the footer. </p>
                <p>This section often contains important links, contact information, social media icons, and sometimes a brief about the company or a sign-up form for newsletters.</p>
                <p>This is the last impression you leave on your visitors, so make it a good one, reflecting the professionalism and comprehensiveness of your site.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Footer image">
                <p>Structured info in a footer does not overload the user</p>

                <div><a href=""><img src="" alt=""> To enhance your understanding, explore the example for using footers in our feature article on Website Footer Design.</a></div>

            <article>
                <h2>5. Slider</h2>
                <p>Up next is the slider.</p>
                <p>Whether it’s the latest offers, featured products, or key messages, the slider lets you present content in an engaging, easily digestible format.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Slider image">
                <p>Compactly presented media via slider saves space on a page</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h2>6. Search</h2>
                <p>Another useful component is a search function tucked away in the header or an easily accessible place.</p>
                <p>Whether your site is packed with loads of media or a wide range of products, a search field helps cut through the clutter.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Search image">
                <p>A search field greatly improves website navigation</p>

            <article>
                <h2>7. Menu and navigation</h2>
                <p>When we think about easy navigation across a webpage, the menu is the main element that comes to mind.</p>
                <p>There are various menu types to choose from, each serving different design needs and user experiences.</p>
                <p>For sites with a wide range of topics or products, the mega menu provides a comprehensive view of all options in one large panel.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Menu and navigation image">
                <p>An interactive menu visually attracts the user</p>

            <article>
                <h2>8. Breadcrumbs</h2>
                <p>Next in line is breadcrumbs. No, we’re not talking about the kind you find in the kitchen, but the digital steps that help guide visitors through your website.</p>
                
                <div><p>The success is in the details, and nowhere is this truer than in the world of web design.</p></div>

                <p>Typically appearing at the top of a page, this navigational feature shows users their current location on your site and how they got there.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Breadcrumbs image">

                <h2>9. Forms</h2>
                <p>Whether it’s for signing up for a newsletter, making a purchase, or getting in touch, forms are the go-to method for visitors to interact and communicate with your site.</p>
                <p>It should ask for only the necessary information, making the process quick and hassle-free.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Forms image">

                <h2>10. Cards</h2>
                <p>Move on to the next element — cards.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Card UI image">

            <article>
                <h2>11. Videos</h2>
                <p>Media materials are a big deal. When was the last time you scrolled past a video without at least a curious glance?</p>
                <p>So, why not harness the power of video on your website?</p>
                <img src="" alt="Videos image">

                <h2>12. Progress indicator</h2>
                <p>Have you ever filled out a form or completed a task online and wondered, “How much longer is this going to take?”</p>
                <p>Think of it as the digital equivalent of breadcrumbs leading to the finish line</p>
                <p>But why stop at just being functional? Get creative with it! Use colors, animations, or even fun little messages that pop up as the user progresses.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>13. Favicon</h2>
                <p>There is another small yet mighty tool — favicon. That is a tiny icon in your browser tab next to a website’s name.</p>
                <p>A favicon is your website’s mini calling card that makes a big impression.</p>
                <p>Creating a favicon is not just about shrinking your logo into a tiny square.</p>

                <img src="" alt="Tags image">

            <article>
                <h2>15. Links</h2>
                <p>Links are your way of guiding visitors around your site and even beyond it.</p>
                <p>You probably clicked on a link, thinking it would take you somewhere, and ended up in a completely unexpected place.</p>
                <img src="" alt="Links image">
                <p>Easy-to-spot links are more likely to be clicked on</p>

                <h2>16. Quality images</h2>
                <p>Let’s shine a spotlight on quality images.</p>
                <p>Check whether each image is in line with your identity, as the wrong visuals can lead to confusion among users.</p>

                <h2>17. Typography</h2>
                <p>We’re close to the finish line, and the next element is typography.</p>
                <p>Then there’s readability. Think about font size, color contrast, and spacing to make text readable.</p>

                <div><a href=""><img src="" alt=""> If you want to learn more about fonts, read our article "24 serif font examples to improve your branding and website design in 2024."</a></div>

            <article>
                <h2>18. White space</h2>
                <p>Time to talk about <a href="">white space</a>, often the invisible element of great web design.</p>
                <p>It doesn’t necessarily have to be white, by the way.</p>
                <p>And balance is critical. Too little white space can turn your site into a cramped one, but too much might make it seem empty or unfinished.</p>

                <h2>19. Sidebar</h2>
                <p>Finally, a sidebar is a trusty sidekick to your website’s main content with extra information or functionality.</p>

                <div><p>A well-crafted sidebar is like a helpful guide, always offering something more.</p></div>

                <p>A well-designed sidebar should be a natural extension of a website tailored to fit the content of your page.</p>
